# Personal Website Hub
A personal website that functions both as a digital resume, as well as an online hub for my projects.

Included are multiple pages as follows:
- Resume/CV complete with my past experience
- Projects page
  - Educ[alcul]ate (iOS/Python-based application)
  - Keeping It Reel (HTML-based website)
  - Conway's Game of Life (Python-based application)
- Contact page

## This is an archived repository, as the website which is present is an outdated build, which is no longer used. To see my current portfolio website repository, please refer to my design-slate repository.
